### PROBLEM STATEMENT OF THE DATA
``` 
A BIKE-SHARING SYSTEM IS A SERVICE IN WHICH BIKES ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR SHARED USE TO INDIVIDUALS ON A SHORT TERM 
BASIS FOR A PRICE OR FREE.MANY BIKE SHARE SYSTEMS ALLOW PEOPLE TO BORROW A BIKE FROM A "DOCK" WHICH IS USUALLY
COMPUTER-CONTROLLED WHEREIN THE USER ENTERS THE PAYMENT INFORMATION, AND THE SYSTEM UNLOCKS IT.
THIS BIKE CAN THEN BE RETURNED TO ANOTHER DOCK BELONGING TO THE SAME SYSTEM.
A US BIKE-SHARING PROVIDER BOOMBIKES HAS RECENTLY SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE DIPS IN THEIR REVENUES DUE TO THE ONGOING CORONA PANDEMIC. 
THE COMPANY IS FINDING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN IN THE CURRENT MARKET SCENARIO. SO, 
IT HAS DECIDED TO COME UP WITH A MINDFUL BUSINESS PLAN 
TO BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE ITS REVENUE AS SOON AS THE ONGOING LOCKDOWN COMES TO AN END, 
AND THE ECONOMY RESTORES TO A HEALTHY STATE.
IN SUCH AN ATTEMPT, BOOMBIKES ASPIRES TO UNDERSTAND THE DEMAND FOR SHARED BIKES AMONG THE PEOPLE AFTER 
THIS ONGOING QUARANTINE SITUATION ENDS ACROSS THE NATION DUE TO COVID-19. 
THEY HAVE PLANNED THIS TO PREPARE THEMSELVES TO CATER TO THE PEOPLE'S NEEDS 
ONCE THE SITUATION GETS BETTER ALL AROUND AND STAND OUT FROM OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS AND MAKE HUGE PROFITS.

THEY HAVE CONTRACTED A CONSULTING COMPANY TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS ON WHICH THE DEMAND FOR THESE SHARED BIKES DEPENDS.
SPECIFICALLY, THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE DEMAND FOR THESE SHARED BIKES IN THE AMERICAN MARKET. 
THE COMPANY WANTS TO KNOW:
•	WHICH VARIABLES ARE SIGNIFICANT IN PREDICTING THE DEMAND FOR SHARED BIKES.
•	HOW WELL THOSE VARIABLES DESCRIBE THE BIKE DEMANDS
BASED ON VARIOUS METEOROLOGICAL SURVEYS AND PEOPLE'S STYLES, 
THE SERVICE PROVIDER FIRM HAS GATHERED A LARGE DATASET ON DAILY BIKE DEMANDS ACROSS THE AMERICAN MARKET BASED ON SOME FACTORS.

## **DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA WITA SHORT NOTE**
- **WE ARE CREATING A MODEL BASED ON THE DATA SET AND PERFORMING THE OPERATION AND FINDING THE FEATURE VARIABLE**
- **IN WHICH YEAR,SEASON,TEMP,WEEKDAY,WORKINGDAY,ETC.....FINDING THE DEMAND OF BIKE**
-  **WHAT WILL BE THE DEMAND OF BIKE ON DIFFERENT VARIABLES**


## THERE AER FOUR MAJOR STEPS WHICH WE WANT TO MAKE OUR MODEL BEST
- **STEP 1 DATA UNDERSTANDING AND DATA CLEANING OR DATA UNDERSTANDING, PREPARATION AND EDA**
    - **PERFORMING EDA LIKE HANDLING MISSING VALUES AND REMOVING UNNECESSARY COLUMNS AND OUTLIER ETC...**
    - **AFTER THAT VISUALISING THE DATA ON THE DIFFERNT VARIABLES ON THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE OR TRAGET VARIBLE**
- **STEP 2 TRAINING DATA IN TO TRAIN & TEST SPLIT**
     - **SPLITING THE TRAIN TEST SPLIT**
     - **DIVIDING THE X&Y TERMS**
     - **RESCALING THE FEATURES PERFORMIONG RESCALE FEATRUE ELMINATION**
     - **ADDING THE CONSTANTS, FITTING THE MODEL, SEEING THE PARAMETERS, AND AT LAST MODEL SUMMARY**
     - **USING VARIENCE INFLATION FACTORS**
     - **DROPPING THE COLUMNS BY SEEING PVALUE AND HIGH VIF OR LOW VIF ETCC....**
- **STEP 3 RESIDUAL ANALYSIS**
- **STEP 4 PREDICTIONS AND EVALUATIONS ON THE TEST DATA SET**

#
## FINAL CONCLUSION
- **THERE ARE SOME FEATURE VARIABLES WHICH CAN INCREASE THE DEMAND OF THE BIKE**
### THERE IS NO CORRECT VALUE FOR MSE. SIMPLY PUT, THE LOWER THE VALUE THE BETTER AND 0 MEANS THE MODEL IS PERFECT. SINCE THERE IS NO CORRECT ANSWER, THE MSE’S BASIC VALUE IS IN SELECTING ONE PREDICTION MODEL OVER ANOTHER.

### SIMILARLY, THERE IS ALSO NO CORRECT ANSWER AS TO WHAT R2 SHOULD BE

- **THE R SQUARED VALUE OF TRAINING SET IS : 0.8519229478939757**
- **THE R SQUARED VALUE OF TEST SET IS : 0.7760830156048715**
- **THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR OF TRAIN IS: 0.007505910601061811**
- **THE MEAN SQUARED ERROR OF TEST IS: 0.010066294557928523**
## Technologies Used
- Python,Jupyter notebook
- Libraries Like Pandas ,Numpy,Matplotlib.pyplot,Plotly.Express,Seaborn
